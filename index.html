            <p>
                Hello, my name is Louis Wood. As you can see, I’m not your typical applicant for a 
                web developer position. I’m no spring chicken, but I hope to convince you that this 
                may work to your advantage. I began my career in IT using code (Visual Basic, BATch 
                files, and the like) to solve problems for a financial services firm in the days when 
                dial-up was a thing. I have held positions of increasing responsibility at two major 
                regional banks, including managing a team of engineers responsible for 1,000 servers 
                and more than 6,500 desktop and laptop PCs. But in the last recession, as banks were 
                either consolidating or failing, my employer was taken over by the F.D.I.C., and 
                along with hundreds of other employees I was shown the door with a very sincere "sorry". 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                My interest has turned to web development. I’ve always been more comfortable as a 
                problem solver than a manager, and I loved getting back to coding. While I had some 
                new languages to learn, the core skills of identifying and specifying requirements and 
                translating these into a digital solution were still alive and well. I put my nose to 
                the grindstone and have now completed more than a dozen courses in PHP, MySQL, HTML, 
                CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, and related topics. I put these new tools to work 
                developing 
                <a href="https://www.daytradeanalytics.com" title="Link to Day Trade Analytics home page" 
                target="_blank">Day&nbsp;Trade&nbsp;Analytics</a>, 
                a robust web app for day traders. Take a look; I think you’ll like what you see. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That brings me to what I desire in the way of employment. I am self-directed and 
                very serious about anything I put my mind to. I am happy back in the 
                problem-solving-with-code business, but I realize that the best way to hone my skills 
                and to achieve the level of expertise that I desire is to work with a production team. 
                I am a dedicated employee and passionate about web development... what I need is to 
                join a team that will allow me to continue to learn while performing meaningful work. 
                If you would like to know more about my background you can see my resume
